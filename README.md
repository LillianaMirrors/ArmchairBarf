# ArmchairBarf


Armchair Barf is a simple little project to get myself warmed up to PCB design. It uses the same form factor as WhoppingPochard / VinnyC's rather popular "Rainbow Barf"

I will openly warn: The design is not tested in reality. Build at your own risk.

The PCB is designed to be easy access, with the AE lit up first, and then the middle ribbon with the last 3 neopixels.
